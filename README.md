### Results

The crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic caused a huge drop in GDP
during 2020, mainly in activities related to services, construction, among
others considered "non-essential". The economic sectors that have been the most
benefited have undoubtedly been (as a few examples) shipping services,
online sales and communications, since any work carried out remotely required
an internet connection. For this reason, in this exercise We decided to compare
between people who obtained a degree related to construction vs. communication
services. Additionally, We decided to do this analysis in two different groups:
white workers and afro-descendant workers; to see what differences in income exist
between people working in the same economic activity according to their race.
Firstly, construction workers have lower incomes compared with many other
activities, however, whites receive on average a higher income ($56,896) compared
to afro-descendant ($30,500), who are on the poverty line. This difference 
could be explained by the position in wich they are occupied within this economic
activity. Regarding communications services, in both cases the salaries of white people
($72,592) and afro-descendent ($54,180) are higher compared to construction.
However, there are also differences between workers in the same economic sector according
to their race. In conclusion, construction workers have been among the most
affected by the crisis, as the sector came to a standstill during the economy's shutdown
and recovery is still in a slow pace in the city's construction industry. Additionally, it's
important to see wich groups of people may be even more vulnerable and
what determines it. In this case, there are racial factors that allow us to
identify that there is still a huge wage gap between white and afro-descendant people, which
aggravates socioeconomic conditions during this crisis.
